# General Notes



## ROS

#### running ROS on 2 machines

In order to run see\read\display topics between two machines run the following commands:

on master machine  (where roscore runs) run:

1. `$export ROS_IP=ip_of_master`

on client machine (not where roscore runs) run:

1. `$export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://ip_addr_of_master:11311`
2. `$export ROS_IP=ip_of_client`

**<u>note:</u>** without the export of ROS_IP, only meta data of messages is available.



## Docker



```$docker images``` - list images

An **image** is an executable package that includes everything needed to run an application--the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables, and configuration files.

A container is launched by running an image.

``$docker ps `` (list of running containers)

A container is a runtime instance of an image--what the image becomes in memory when executed (that is, an image with state, or a user process)

``$docker --version`` - version of installed docker
``$docker version`` - more details

`docker container ls --all`  - the `all` flag lists also containers that have exited.



#### Cheat sheet

```shell
## List Docker CLI commands
docker
docker container --help

## Display Docker version and info
docker --version
docker version
docker info

## Execute Docker image
docker run hello-world

## List Docker images
docker image ls

## List Docker containers (running, all, all in quiet mode)
docker container ls
docker container ls --all
docker container ls -aq
```

The hierarchy of docker app:

A container, which [this page](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/part2/) covers. Above this level is a service, which defines how containers behave in production, covered in [Part 3](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/part3/). Finally, at the top level is the stack, defining the interactions of all the services, covered in [Part 5](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/part5/).

- Stack
- Services
- Container (Define a container with `Dockerfile`)

Create hector-slam docker:

1. Create a Dockerfile (based on [link](https://github.com/osrf/docker_images/blob/460ddc4707530c2179788e2100d5c624cf2af3d7/ros/kinetic/ubuntu/xenial/desktop-full/Dockerfile)):

```bash
# This is an auto generated Dockerfile for ros:desktop-full
# generated from docker_images/create_ros_image.Dockerfile.em
FROM osrf/ros:kinetic-desktop-xenial

# install ros packages
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    ros-kinetic-desktop-full=1.3.2-0* \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

2. run `$docker build --tag=ros-desktop-full .` 

These interactive shells will exit after running any scripted commands, unless they are run in an interactive terminal - so for this example to not exit, you need to docker run -it alpine /bin/sh.

3. run `$docker run -it ros-base /bin/sh . ` (interactive mode) Now you are in the container.

   In a different shell you could see the running container by typing `docker container ls -a`.

4. commit changes

   after some progress (init catkin workspace, install hector_slam.... and so on) don't exit container (all installations will be deleted)!
   

   obtain container ID: `docker container ls`:

   ```bash
   CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                     COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
   fd275287a981        ros-desktop-full:latest   "/ros_entrypoint.sh â€¦"   17 minutes ago      Up 17 minutes                           vibrant_thompson
   
   ```

   then, commit the changes:

   `docker commit fd275287a981 ros-kinetic:initAndHector`

   now when running `docker images`:

   ```bash
   REPOSITORY          TAG                      IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
   ros-kinetic         initAndHector            0bbccef193a9        6 minutes ago       3.41GB
   ros-desktop-full    latest                   15f9986beb1f        25 minutes ago      3.37GB
   osrf/ros            kinetic-desktop-xenial   71161c7adeb0        4 days ago          2.32GB
   alpine              latest                   961769676411        11 days ago         5.58MB
   
   ```

   5. return to previous commit:

      `docker run -it ros-kinetic:initAndHector`
